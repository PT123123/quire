# Architecture Decision Records

Format: decision → context → consequences. Newest first.

## ADR-0008 · Popup lifecycle is state-driven, never `is-open`-read
Decision: `CommandPalette` uses `close-policy: no-auto-close`; show/hide is
driven exclusively by `UIState.palette-open` (mirrored in AppWindow with
`show()`/`close()` handlers).
Why: Slint 1.18.0's const-propagation pass panics (`const_propagation.rs:
464`, no diagnostics) whenever a popup component *reads* its own `is-open`.
Verified by bisection with the `QUIRE_PROBE` subset-compile hook in build.rs.
Consequences: closing logic lives in UIState, which also makes the palette
testable from Rust; revisit if a future Slint fixes the crash.

## ADR-0007 · Page chrome rides inside delegates (ListView single-`for`)
Decision: a `ListView` may contain exactly one `for`; the page title and the
bottom spacer therefore live inside the first/last `DocumentRow` delegate
(`first` index check, `BlockRow.tail` flag set by Rust).
Why: 1.18 markup rejects sibling elements of a ListView `for`, and models
expose no `.length` to compute "last row" in the UI.
Consequences: Rust owns the `tail` invariant; re-sorting or appending blocks
must re-flag it (see `with_tail` in state.rs).

## ADR-0006 · M1 UI state via a single `UIState` global
Decision: transient UI state (dark, sidebar-open, palette state, selection
ids) lives in one Slint global; business actions are callbacks on that same
global, wired in `src/app/controller.rs`.
Why: components stay independently restorable; Rust reaches everything
through one generated accessor; there is exactly one place an agent must
read to understand UI state flow.
Consequences: property names are a contract — renaming requires touching
controller.rs and any component in the same change.

## ADR-0005 · Mock content is served through Slint models
Decision: sidebar tree, blocks, and command rows arrive from Rust as
`ModelRc<VecModel<struct>>`, even for M1 mock data.
Why: establishes the node-editor-cpp pattern (backend owns models, UI only
renders) before any real document model exists, so M3/M4 replace data
sources, not plumbing.
Consequences: mock data has the same shape discipline as real data.

## ADR-0004 · Renderer is a per-binary compile-time choice
Decision: `slint` is compiled with `default-features = false`; exactly one
renderer feature is enabled per build (`femtovg` default; `femtovg-wgpu`,
`skia`, `skia-opengl`, `software` selectable). Benchmarks build one binary
per renderer into its own target dir.
Why: comparing GPU stacks at runtime inside one binary would distort
memory numbers; separate binaries keep idle-RAM measurements honest.
Consequences: CI builds at least two renderer configurations.

## ADR-0003 · No TextEdit per block
Decision: static blocks render as `Text` + shapes; only the focused block
will own a real editing surface (M4), plus ListView-based virtualization
from the first commit.
Why: 10 000 interactive widgets is a guaranteed memory/CPU failure mode.
Consequences: caret/selection rendering inside the focused block must be
built deliberately (Slint TextInput + our selection model), not assumed.

## ADR-0002 · Windows IME = Slint + DirectWrite, no custom TSF
Decision: rely on Slint's winit text input (which uses OS IME composition
events); write a platform adapter only if a reproducible Slint/Windows bug
forces it.
Why: the previous input-method project proved TSF integration is the most
expensive kind of platform coupling; this app must stay agent-maintainable.
Consequences: Chinese input quality is a test item at M4, not a feature to
build.

## ADR-0001 · Slint + Rust, single process, no web runtime
Decision: Slint 1.18.x UI in the same process as the Rust core; SQLite for
persistence (M3); no Electron/Tauri/WebView/React/Vue anywhere.
Why: GPU-accelerated native rendering with real low-RAM/low-idle-CPU
behavior, and one language boundary (`.slint` ↔ Rust) that coding agents
can maintain for years.
Consequences: rich text editing and IME polish must be built rather than
inherited from a browser engine; this is accepted deliberately.

## Dependency policy
Every crate must answer: why needed / can std do it / runtime memory cost /
extra threads / build complexity. Current set: slint + slint-build only.
Anything else waits for a milestone that cannot be built without it.
