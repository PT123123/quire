//                  `ModelRc<DbRow>` ->  the block's delegate, which only draws
//
// Four things in here are deliberate and each has a reason:
//
// 1. **The window is computed by `core::database::window` and nowhere else**, so
//    "先算可见窗口再取行" is one function rather than a rule three callers
//    remember (ADR-0067).
// 2. **A scroll only re-reads when the window moved.** Overscan is what buys
//    that: the window is a screenful plus eight rows above and below, so 256 px
//    of scrolling costs one read instead of one per frame. The arithmetic runs
//    every time; the *query* runs when `window.start` changes.
// 3. **The rows live in a model of their own** (`DbWindow::rows`), cloned into
//    the block's row. A re-read therefore replaces one model and one outer row
//    (`set_row_data`) instead of rebuilding the page's whole row list, which is
//    what makes scrolling a 10 000-row database cost one query and one row.
// 4. **The anchor is reported, not measured.** Rust cannot see Slint's layout,
//    so the block tells it where its top is relative to the viewport
//    (`database-viewport`), and Rust turns that into "how far into the database
//    is the reader": `offset = scroll - top`, clamped at zero. One reported
//    number per scroll frame per database block, and no I/O while it is static.

/// One database block's realized window: the rows that exist as objects, which
/// window of the database they are, and the model the delegate reads.
///
/// The columns are part of the window rather than read fresh each projection,
/// because a row's cells and its header have to come from *one* definition: the
/// `RowView`s in `rows` were painted against exactly this column list, and a
/// header built from a newer definition would label the cells with the wrong
/// names — the kind of defect that looks like a sorting bug.

        //   (D4's `group_window`): `COUNT(*)` / the group counts first, then
        //   exactly the window's rows.
        // * **board** — card *slots*: slot `s` is one horizontal band across
        //   every column, so the board is `max(column counts)` slots tall and
        //   each group fetches its own slice of that band (`board_window`).
        //   The columns themselves are the group list — one `GROUP BY` over an
        //   option-bounded column, a handful of rows, never one per card.
        // * **gallery** — card *rows*: one slice of `per_row × rows` cards.
        // * **calendar** — the month grid is fixed (6×7), so the window is
        //   *inside a day*: one `GROUP BY` over the date column for the month's
        //   counts (≤ 31 rows) and at most [`CALENDAR_PEEK`] records per day,
        //   the rest folded into the cell's count. A month filter — `>= the
        //   1st`, `< the 1st of the next` — is compiled by the same clause
        //   compiler the panel's rules use, so bytes-are-time (ADR-0062) is
        //   doing the date arithmetic in SQL.
        // * **timeline** — lanes like rows, plus one aggregate query for the
        //   axis (`column_bounds`: `min`/`max` over the same `WHERE`); a lane
        //   with no date never enters the statement, because the request is
        //   ANDed with an `is not empty` clause on the date column — the
        //   brief's 「无日期不显示」 as SQL, not as a Rust `retain`.

    // contracts live in this section, and each is a shape rather than a rule:
    //
    // 1. **The recompute unit is the window, never the table** (SPEC's red
    //    line 「禁止每次输入全库重算」). Formulas are evaluated in
    //    `db_paint_formulas`, over exactly the rows a view realized — the same
    //    31-or-so rows every other column paints for. There is no path that
    //    walks all of `db_records` to evaluate anything, and the two knobs that
    //    would force one — sorting and filtering by a formula column — are
    //    refused upstream (`PropertyKind::sort_column` is `None`,
    //    `FilterOp::ops_for` is empty for the computed kinds), because "sort by
    //    a computed value" in SQL means "compute it for every row first".
    // 2. **Dependencies are same-row, by construction.** `FormulaSource` is
    //    built for one record; the engine's cell callback has no record
    //    parameter. Editing cell (r, q) can therefore change formula values
    //    only on row r, and only in columns whose parsed dependencies
    //    (transitively, through other formula columns) name q — the dependency
    //    set the save-time cycle check and the export's preload both walk.
